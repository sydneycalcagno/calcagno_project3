ABOUT THIS PROJECT
------------------------
This project is a game created with mutliple functions. I personally used this project to challenge me and make me a better coder. I wanted to get more familiar with pointers and refernces to prepare for data structures and I also included a couple on new things I've learned such as \t (tab), srand(time()), cin.ignore(256, '\n') (ignore until new line) and some other smaller, simple things. 

The goal of the game is to win by defeating hackers. You can buy parts, talk to NPC, go to stack overflow, explore rooms and more!

This took me lots of time and it does complile! If it's not compiling PLEASE let me know.
